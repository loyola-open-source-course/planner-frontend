For this planner, you can create an account using your name, username, and a password. Once you login with your username and password, you can see cards created by other users. The cards show the task, date and time created, and the name of the person who created it as well when the card was updated. If the card was not changed, it will say “Invalid date.” If it was changed, it will show the time and date. You can add your own cards, edit, delete, or--if you decide you don’t want the card when you’re about to add it or if you change your mind about editing the card--cancel them. You can create a card in either of the three columns: To Do, In Progress, and Done. When you add a card, you can drag and drop it into any column you wish. When you log out and log back in, your cards are saved.
